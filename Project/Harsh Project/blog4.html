                                        (Debate Topics) by Harsh Raj</h1>
                                    <h2>For</h2>
                                    <h3>Let’s have a look at what is climate change. Climate change is a long-term
                                        change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local,
                                        regional and global climates.</h3>
                                    <h3>Today, I also wanna tell you the tale of two planets Earth and Venus. Earth and
                                        Venus are essentially the same size and essentially the same distance from the
                                        sun. And both have almost the same amount of carbon. The difference
                                        is
                                        that in the earth the carbon is trapped in the ground in the form of natural gas
                                        whereas on venus it’s trapped in the atmosphere. As a result, the average
                                        temperature of the earth is around 50 degrees whereas in Venus it’s around
                                        850 degrees. All I wanna say is Mercury is closer to the Sun but it’s three
                                        times cooler than Venus. This is the current scenario of developing nations.
                                        They are taking ground-based carbon and ejecting it into the atmosphere.</h3>
                                    <h3>The accumulated amount of man-made global warming pollution that is up in the
                                        atmosphere, in that thin shell is trapping the energy equivalent of 400,000
                                        Hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours 365 days a year.
                                        Just
                                        picture that, that is a lot of heat.</h3>
                                    <h3>2011-2020 was the warmest decade recorded, with global average temperature
                                        reaching 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels in 2019. Human-induced global warming
                                        is presently increasing at a rate of 0.2°C per decade. An increase of
                                        2°C
                                        compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is associated with serious
                                        negative impacts on the natural environment and human health and wellbeing,
                                        including a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic
                                        changes
                                        in the global environment will occur.</h3>
                                    <h3>The direct consequences of man-made climate change include raising maximum and
                                        minimum temperatures, rising sea levels, higher ocean temperatures, an increase
                                        in heavy precipitation or rainfall, an increase in the proportion of
                                        violent tropical cyclones, decline in Arctic sea ice and snow cover, and many
                                        more.</h3>
                                    <h3>Climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity. I know there are a lot of
                                        issues out there but the earth is moving in a direction where we cannot survive
                                        then all issues out there are going to be irrelevant.</h3>

                                    <h2>Against</h2>
                                    <h3>So, first of all I wanna say according to me climate change is definitely a
                                        issue. But it’s not like that it is going to end humanity today. I don’t think
                                        that climate change is our biggest problem because climate has changed
                                        since before man ever existed on the planet and it’s just a continuous process.
                                    </h3>
                                    <h3>The Earth is on track to warm up to two degrees Celsius this century, but
                                        winter’s not going to disappear altogether in many parts of the world. Record
                                        low temperatures will just become rarer.</h3>
                                    <h3>We do not know what negative and positive effects climate change will have
                                        around the world in the next 100 years. Many climate scientists have exaggerated
                                        the potential risks due to global warming. here is no reason to believe
                                        that developed societies won’t be able to cope with any climate changes nature
                                        may throw at us.</h3>
                                    <h3>Earth’s climate record shows that warming has preceded, not followed, a rise in
                                        CO2. According to a study published in Science, measurements of ice core samples
                                        showed that over the last past 240,000 years, periods of natural
                                        global warming preceded global increases in CO2. there is some correlation, but
                                        little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global
                                        temperature through the millennia. </h3>
                                    <h3>Arctic ice increased in volume by 50% in 2012 alone. Core measures of the Arctic
                                        ice show that it has increased in volume since 2012, which argues against global
                                        warming, causing ice caps to melt. Climate Depot reported that the
                                        latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the
                                        University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent
                                        since 2012 – The Danish Polar Portal, which monitors ice and climate in the
                                        Arctic, reported on the 12th of September this year. Few people have even
                                        predicted that global warming would cause whole Arctic ice to melt, which
                                        contradicts their version.</h3>
                                    <h3>Early Predictions about the Effects of Warming Have Been Proven Wrong. Al Gore
                                        predicted that all Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. But, on the contrary,
                                        Arctic ice is up by 50% since 2012.</h3>
                                    <h3>We have to open our eyes to far worse problems than climate change like poverty,
                                        inequality. We should do some things for climate change on an individual level
                                        like using electric vehicles, saving electricity, and other kinds of
                                        stuff for the environment but seriously it’s not like it’s going to end humanity
                                        today.</h3>
