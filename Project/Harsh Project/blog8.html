                                    <h3>I'm an eighteen-year-old boy and I am a movie nerd. I have watched at least 1000
                                        Indian films and 400 foreign films in which most of which are from Hollywood. I
                                        am not the kind of person who watches genre-specific films. I just
                                        want a
                                        movie that is the perfect mixture of a good story, direction, production, score,
                                        cinematography all other technical aspects. Now, if we talk about Indian cinema
                                        then almost every film can be included under the musical genre. So, I
                                        had
                                        watched a lot of Indian musicals but only saw Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin in
                                        Hollywood musicals.
                                    </h3>
                                    <h3>It's June 2021. At this time I had appeared for two attempts of JEE and I was
                                        frustrated with my results. So, just to fresh my mind I started watching La La
                                        Land. I didn't know the level of this movie at that time. This movie is
                                        about
                                        two dreamers Mia who wanna become an actress and Sebastian who wants to open his
                                        Jazz club. They met at the club then at the party and they didn't like each
                                        other. After this, they met at the coffee shop where Mia was a barista.
                                        They told
                                        each other about their dream and why they wanna become that. Sebastian gave Mia
                                        an idea if no one was casting you then write your own story and act on that. He
                                        told her don't care what the world will think about her. He said, "I
                                        don't
                                        care what other people think as long as I am happy". He also told her about
                                        Jazz. After that, they fell in love and started living together.</h3>
                                    <h3>One morning when Mia was talking with her mother about Seb that he hadn't
                                        secured a job yet and Seb heard all of that. Then he joined his friend's band
                                        instead of focusing on his dream. At that time, Mia was trying to realize
                                        his
                                        dream
                                        but he got frustrated and Mia left the home. The stageplay of Mia was also not
                                        received well and few people showed up. She lose all of her hope and went to his
                                        home to do something else other than acting. After a few days,
                                        Sebastian
                                        got a
                                        call from a casting director who attended Mia's play for Mia. Seb went to Mia's
                                        home but at this stage, Mia gave up her hope. Mia said, "Maybe I'm not good
                                        enough! It's like a pipe dream." Seb replied to her, "This is the dream!
                                        It's
                                        conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!". Finally, Seb
                                        convinced Mia to the audition and the audition went well. Now, Seb called Mia to
                                        give 100% to her dream and not to think about their relationship if she
                                        wants to
                                        achieve all of her dreams. It's true love because they cared for others' dreams
                                        in place of their happiness.</h3>
                                    <h3>It's time for the climax. The story took place five years later. Now Mia is a
                                        famous actress and married to another man with whom she had a daughter. One
                                        night the couple went to the Jazz club. When Mia entered then she noticed
                                        the logo
                                        that she had designed once designed for Seb. Mia realizes that Seb opened his
                                        jazz club. When Seb spots Mia in the crowd, he begins to play their love theme
                                        on the piano. A dream sequence unfolds in which the two imagine what
                                        might
                                        have
                                        been had their relationship thrived along with their careers. Seb and Mia
                                        acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles before she leaves. The
                                        experience of watching this movie is amazing. The soundtrack of this film is
                                        on
                                        another level. Mia-Seb theme is now my ringtone. The ending of the movie makes
                                        me cry and makes me sad for a week. If you haven't watched it yet then watch it
                                        now! </h3>
