                                    <h3>It's 2022 and we can't think about our lives without the word tech. Tech or
                                        technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes,
                                        especially in industries. So, this is the bookish definition of it. Let's
                                        have a look at the origin of this word. The word technology comes from two Greek
                                        words techne and logos. Techne means skill and logos means word. So, it's the
                                        word that describes how we have improved our lives with our skills.
                                        Humans have improved a huge number of things with their skills. We have made
                                        skyscrapers, advanced medical equipment, we can see and talk to a person who is
                                        thousands of miles away, we can fly like a dragon, and we are trying to
                                        expand our civilization to other planets. There are too many things that we can
                                        talk about in this techy concept. So, in short, we are living in the age of
                                        miracles. But how it is affecting our health. Let's have a look.</h3>
                                    <h3>There's a saying Health is the Wealth, and we can't do anything properly if
                                        we're not healthy. So, what's healthy. We have learned in childhood that
                                        disease-free and healthy are two different things. So, if we talk about healthy
                                        then we should be mentally fit, physically fit, and living in a good
                                        environment. Now, if we again come to the term technology then it is affecting
                                        our health in many ways. Now, We are measuring our heartbeat with our watch, we
                                        can
                                        maintain our diet and know all secret nutrition facts with a single click on the
                                        internet, we are curing a huge number of diseases that were supposed to be
                                        incurable, and for those who don't have a good environment and not a
                                        single
                                        friend has the opportunity to connect with the world and live happily in the
                                        virtual world of social media. We can resist extreme cold and heat with techy
                                        gadgets heater and air conditions. So, technology made our lives marvelous.
                                        But with every blessing comes a curse.</h3>
                                    <h3>Now, let's have a look at the dark side of the effects of tech on our health.
                                        Watches or fitness band keeps us updated with our heartbeat rate, blood
                                        pressure, and so on. According to some research, now people are doing
                                        overthinking about that. They keep checking their health status every 10-15
                                        minutes and are always worried about that which is not good for mental health.
                                        Social Media which are supposed to connect people globally so people would
                                        not feel alone and depressed is making people depressed and ill. On average a
                                        phone user uses 2.5 hrs social media per day and in the worst scenario, they
                                        forgot about their real-world which is not good for anyone's mental as well
                                        as physical health because too much screen time is not good for the eyes. Social
                                        media impacts our mental health in one more way, people are now not happy with
                                        their looks, and they are just jealous of others' posts and they want
                                        more likes, comments, and followers and they are wasting their time and mental
                                        health in this madness. Air conditions that save us from extreme weather produce
                                        a gas CFC which is depleting the ozone layer.</h3>
                                    <h3>We have seen that technology and tech gadgets which are improving our health and
                                        lifestyle in a way are also defecting it in another way. So, is tech good or
                                        bad! Nothing bad is ever truly bad. Nothing good is ever truly good.
                                        So,
                                        in the end, it depends on how we are using it. Technology has some disadvantages
                                        but it's nothing compared to its advantages. We have defeated a pandemic with
                                        the help of technology. In most cases, humans are properly using tech
                                        and
                                        if we continued this then it'll super beneficial for our health.</h3>
